# micro:bit Loves your Plants

## micro:bit loves your plants and will take care of them

Take care (in the STEAM way) of  plants/small garden using micro:bit 

### Entry level
* Using https://www.digitspace.com/products/micro-bit/kit/microbit-kit-automatic-watering-pump-soil-humidity-detection-with-main-board 
* Some temperature sensors (DHT22 or GY-21-HTU21) 
* light sensors (LDR) Do you have a UV light sensor?
* I would add a visual rgb indicator as the https://www.digitspace.com/products/micro-bit/breakout/bbc-microbit-expansion-board-full-color-led-module-rgb-usb-charging-battery . 
* I want to use micropython.
I think this could be a really cool project.

### Pro level
* Using ESP32 instead of the micro:bit, 
* adding an ESP-CAM https://www.digitspace.com/wifi-ble-module-esp32-serial-wifi-camera-esp32-cam?search=esp32&description=true&page=4 and 
* publishing data via wifi.  
* I want to use micropython for the two versions.
